```{r}
#read in files as data frames
fastq <- as.data.frame(read.csv('~/Desktop/fastq-files.csv')) #all unprocessed data
dedup <- as.data.frame(read.csv('~/Desktop/deduped-files.csv')) #the data that has been processed successfully

#give column names
names(dedup) <- c("dedup-files")
names(fastq) <- c("fastq-files")

#filter for unique values
unprocessed <- fastq %>% filter(!(fastq$`fastq-files` %in% dedup$`dedup-files`)) # which accession Nos were not processed?

unprocessed
# looks like:
#fastq-files
